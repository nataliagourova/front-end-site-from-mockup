      <h3>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h3>
      <p>Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or 
      knees and purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick 
      paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then 
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com">retire to the warmest spot</a> 
      on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap 
      attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop 
      onto the floor; what’s your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself 
      intently cough and swat at dog. 
      </p>
      <p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the dog likes me. 
      Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide 
      in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always hungry 
      for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.
